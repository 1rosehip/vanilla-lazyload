# üó∫ HOW TO UPDATE FROM PREVIOUS VERSIONS

## Version 15 to 16

**If you were using the `callback_reveal` callback**

You should replace `callback_reveal` with `callback_loading` in your JS code.

**If you were using the instance `load(element)` method**

You should replace the `load(element)` with `LazyLoad.load(element, settings)`

```js
const myLazyLoad = new LazyLoad({/* settings */});
// FROM
myLazyLoad.load(element);
// TO
LazyLoad.load(element, {/* settings */});
```

Note that the settings object of the `load` method can be different. If none are provided, the default options will apply.

**If you were using `auto_unobserve: false`**

You should replace `auto_unobserve` with `unobserve_completed`.

```js
const myLazyLoad = new LazyLoad({
   // FROM
   auto_unobserve: false,
   // TO
   unobserve_completed: false,
});
```

**If you were using the `load_delay` option**

You should change `load_delay: ___` with `cancel_on_exit: true`.

```js
const myLazyLoad = new LazyLoad({
   // FROM
   load_delay: 300,
   // TO
   cancel_on_exit: true,
});
```

## Version 14 to 15

**If you have background images loaded via `data-src`**

You should replace `data-src` with `data-bg` in your markup/DOM

```html
<!-- FROM -->
<div data-src="background.jpg">...</div>
<!-- TO -->
<div data-bg="background.jpg">...</div>
```

Alternatively, you could pass `src` in the `data_bg` option

```js
new LazyLoad({ /* other options? */ data_bg: "src" });
```

**If you have single background images loaded via `data-bg`**

You must remove the `url()` part from the `data-bg` attribute values

```html
<!-- FROM -->
<div data-bg="url(background.jpg)">...</div>
<!-- TO -->
<div data-bg="background.jpg">...</div>
```

**If you have multipe background images loaded via `data-bg`**

You must change the attribute to `data-bg-multi`

```html
<!-- FROM -->
<div data-bg="url(background1.jpg), url(background2.jpg)">...</div>
<!-- TO -->
<div data-bg-multi="url(background1.jpg), url(background2.jpg)">...</div>
```
